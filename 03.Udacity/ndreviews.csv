Plus, one thing I thought where it exceeded my expectations was knowing which model to select for the analysis - I thought I wouldn’t feel very confident picking a model, but it was the exact opposite.	2016-10-25T23:38:34.485Z	u500110

One way I think the nanodegree could be improved is to give the student a bit more of a business analytics foundation rather than simply teaching the technical aspects of Alteryx and Tableau. 	2016-12-21T21:48:20.561Z	3166388946

I would advise studying using the internet as a guide. The Alteryx documentation itself covers a lot of the Alteryx based content. Tableau tutorials are available on many different sites for free.

The course video can be adjusted to speed up to 2.0 but a nice 1.25 is my preferred viewing speed.

That added to the confusion that can be seen in the forum, only heightens the difficulty of understanding and delivering the tasks requested. It is an expensive course, and the material is maintenance free. For those who live in Brazil a course of this cost half a salary. So it is expensive and important to me. Unfortunately it seems that it is not so important for those responsible for the preparation or maintenance of course material. It's my first paid course at udacity and I confess I expected a lot more.	2017-01-23T13:51:17.777Z	1968668878

I enjoy learning really much, being excited everyday back home to learn online, while when it comes to projects, I always spend so much time (probably more than 10 hours for every project!) on trivial issues. For example, I might spend hours just trying to put 2 different data source into one tableau worksheet/dashboard.
I agree that nowadays you can always find help and answers on google, while considering it's  just a nanodegree, which I think is supposed to teach some basic concepts and inspire students, tackling with all those trivial issues are too tired for me as merely a student.

I am here now and truly believe that each course will be as comprehensive as the last and any of the unanticipated gaps in my knowledge base will be surprisingly present in course.

This is a perfect course if you are in the process of changing career and a bit intimidated by the learning process."	2017-01-31T20:03:31.706Z	124624231

本课程真的需要大量的时间来完成，特别是作业部分，3天左右 满负荷的工作才能较好的完成课程大作业，老师在批改作业方面是相当苛刻的，哪怕是一丁点瑕疵，老师也不会让你通过，从某种方面上来说是会增加学生的挫败感的，但是另一方面又提高了纳米学位的含金量。
我认为对我最有用的是第2,3,4,5课，2课的python技巧，3课的数据库知识、4课的R作图和5课的机器学习初步知识讲的相当精彩。第6课对于没有JAVAscript和css经验的人来说相当吃力；第7课，课程的讲课的模式值得商榷，大部分时间都是两个谷歌工程师在讲他们的经验，实际上学生在他们的谈话中得到知识并不多，比如为什么分析单位要和转移单位要一致也是一笔带过，很多人在论坛中反映作业和视频中间隔着很大的鸿沟，基本上没有论坛老师的指导是不太可能自己独立完成的。
总之，感谢优达学城提供的人生第二次选择职业的机会，谢谢！"	2017-01-26T04:34:18.840Z	8264136247

1.课程设置挺不错的，大部分都比较通俗易懂，交互性很强，视频里会穿插很多练习，让人能保持专注；
2.以实战为主，理论讲得比较浅（但讲得还是比较好的，尤其是统计学部分），这和课程定位有关；
3.项目评审还是比较用心的，提交项目时附上的问题评审员都会帮忙解决，这点很好；
4.光听课的话项目是绝对做不好的，就个人经验而言，每个项目的完成还需要搜索查阅很多博客、文档以及Stackoverflow的相关问答，在这个过程中可以学到很多东西。
5.总的来说，课程体验是相当不错的，涉及了数据分析的方方面面，让初学者对这个行业有一个总体的把握；但如果想要精通，要走的路还很长。"	2017-01-09T01:10:57.729Z	9686862404

Surely I updated my toolbox with newer tools such as Python, MongoDB and R, and now I'm able to use them. Coaches are also available and always well clear in their review. I really suggest this course to anybody, from people wanting to start a career path in data analysis to professionals wanting to better learn how data analysis can improve their job.	2016-11-25T18:42:12.041Z	8614070253

In just a few short months, I have gone from knowing nothing about data analysis to solving real-world problems at my company. All of the courses in this Nanodegree are designed to teach as much information as possible in relatable situations and scenarios, so that the maximum amount of information is retained. 

You learn about things like working with pandas (not the cuddly kind), extracting and data munging from JSON and XML files, and even the diamond industry and what variables determine the price of diamonds. I highly recommend this Nanodegree!"	2016-11-04T03:32:50.235Z	7710740781

My advice to future nanodegree students would be to make sure that you're completely committed to the program for a year before signing up. It'll really help you drive to completion if you make studying for the nanodegree a formal part of your weekly schedule.  "	2016-09-23T06:49:03.389Z	175371734

When I originally chose my path just after high school I didn't realise I was going into a declining field and that the digital revolution was about to change things so much. For a while programming and ticking the necessary boxes to break into this field was very much inside knowledge and Udacity has done a great job of making the technical as well as practical steps available to those who might not have been programming since they were eight. Also, the mix of videos and hands on as well as the forum make you feel part of something. The webcasts too. The content is fantastic, there are many curated links. I use the forum a lot, have not yet used the one-on-one appointments but it is very nice to know they are there in case the need truly arises one day. In the past I had some brief learning experiences with other online course providers but can clearly say that this course is definitely a step above anything I tried before.	2016-03-18T19:15:44.835Z	3567338969

The lectures and short exercises are well arranged and helps build your understanding in to a topic and also builds the ground work for the project which needs to be built at the end of each course. The Project work is challenging, which requires good understanding of the topics covered and some research on related topics and coming up with your own ideas. The Project rubric gives you an idea of what is expected out of the project before hand and the evaluation is based on this rubric and the feedback provided to improve upon the project is detailed and very helpful in building your understanding more into the topic. I am very much satisfied with the course and am able to keep up with the Market without disturbing my schedule much	2016-02-16T18:39:57.973Z	599858545

The instruction is excellent and the topic curation is very solid. It's modern, clean looking, with high quality sound and visuals. And the flexible structure is so appreciated - the problem sets and quizes are there for me as useful structure and interactivity.  But I'm not shackled by them - I can choose to blast through a lesson's lectures when I would rather apply the concepts on my own terms.

It's great to see the Udacity staff is actively improving the offering - after I started the degree, the staff switched out one of the clumsier modules for a shiny new Numpy/Pandas primer (P2) - don't miss it.

I've found that bringing in other sources (for me: Introduction to Statistical Learning, various books from O'Reilly) is required for truly learning this stuff. And if you're like me, coming in with a minimal programming background, be prepared to debug code constantly with dozens of daily visits to Stack Overflow and python/R docs. If anything, nine months part time is an aggressive timeline, especially if you're complementing each topic with other learning sources and trying to apply them in real time to your own field. 

Get ready to tap your inner love of learning, because you'll need some serious persistence to tackle this Nanodegree decisively. Good luck!"	2016-02-01T06:05:25.224Z	5139179282

The way that the Nanodegree is designed helps you consolidate knowledge you already have, appropriate new knowledge through continuous hands-on coding practice, and the final projects are a great way to improve your problem-solving skills, your perseverence, and to increase your code reportory. If you are willing to develop a more analytical, determined mindset, this is an excellent mechanism.

I would say I probably spent around ~660 hours (~15 hours a week for 11 months) working on it. I know this is way over the estimated average time but I had almost no experience and I also have a demanding full-time job in a different field of engineering. I'm certain if one were to devote themselves full-time to it, or had previous experience, they could finish in a much shorter amount of time. I did also spend a lot of extra time doing things that were related, but were ultimately irrelevant with regards to completing the projects.

My main complaint about the Nanodegree is that it is extremely broad in scope since it touches on almost every single aspect of data analysis. From what I've seen, there aren't too many job positions out there that would require you to do every single thing that this Nanodegree goes through. What you end up with is a lot of breadth and not too much depth unless you put in a lot of extra time on your own. That being said, I do think the courses provide great jumping off points for further research and taking charge of your own learning is something that I think is good to do no matter what. No educational program will spoon feed you exactly what you need to know for life/work. Some of the projects themselves were a bit unfocused or their premise seemed contrived and not useful to me (e.g. the first project and a little bit of the machine learning project). But, the worst lesson (second one, in my opinion) has since been replaced with a course and project that seems much more focused and relevant. A SQL course has also been added so now I feel like the only other major gap is 'big data/cloud' stuff (e.g. Hadoop, Spark, etc.). 

I don't know if this Nanodegree is something that could land you a job on its own as I have yet to try applying for anything. My current feeling is no because it is too broad and lacks depth I assume employers look for, but I obviously don't know for sure. At the very least, I think it's a great starting point and learning should be an ongoing and iterative experience anyways. It was definitely challenging at times but I'm glad I did it and think it was worth it - even if I don't get a job!"	2016-08-15T20:31:56.317Z	4749278562

Some times it was awesome (esp Sebastian T ML part), sometimes morale dropped down below the floor and frustration overwhelmed with a strong desire to give up...
It is difficult to get a 1-2-1 coaching sessions within reasonable time. From my experience sessions are to be booked 2 weeks in advance (unless you are fine with sessions at 2-3am). It may be dependent on timezone. I am in GMT.
I found coaching sessions not very useful as the session I had was a chat. So it was difficult to share drawings, express ideas etc. It was very slow because of constant typing, lags etc. From time to time I thought if the coach was really there or went to have some tea. 
Coaching sessions with video or at least with audio would be much much better and useful.
Project reviews can take time. Especially annoying to get a review several days after submission and with very few constructive/helping comments.
Discussion forums can be improved in sense of performance (my machine used to go mad with 100% CPU spent by Chrome when I tried to open forums. now it is better but more can be done). Usefulness of the link to forums under video is close to 0. As the link leads just to forums. I think it would be better if it could lead to a video related discussions which would save lots of time on searches etc.
Several broken links in the course which have been reported but no one seems to be bothered with fixing them.
The A/B Testing part of the course could have been much better. A form of a dialogue is not the best for this kind of topics. It doesn't have to be so complicated, rather it can be done much better and student won't be so frustrated by not hearing key words/concepts in instructors dialogues. Quizzes and practical examples are too isolated and too simplified.

I am sorry for being so critical. I have enjoyed the degree and would like it to be better for people who will take in the future. "	2016-08-02T13:09:07.729Z	711128725

My main criticism is 1) there is a certain lack of coherence between courses, with certain overlap, which sometime gives a disconnected feeling 2) the evaluation of the code through the embedded Python interpreter is just not good enough. It is only manageable if you code locally and copy/paste the answer, but then there are various issues with downloading the data sets locally and trying to guess what the evaluation ""assertions"" want to see. I would find more useful an online notebook system with more complex automatic checkers. Sometimes there are also issues trying to find the data sets, and on occasions those data sets are not he same than the ones you are evaluated against in the embedded interpreter (e.g. a subset).  All in all, it is a pity that great content, great instructors and great practical exercises are let down with the system used to do the coding and quiz evaluation.

A lot of the projects had the option to choose your own data, which I liked, and were promptly reviewed. The whiteboard-type lectures are well made and have corresponding quizzes at a good rate. I also liked the interviews of professionals working in the field.
The final projects were broadly well made and really made me test ou t the skills.
Now to negatives. I felt there was a lot of 'filler' - relatovely obvious or shallpw little videos, such as the one looking over the Napoleon map. All the quizes that required forum participation are the equivalent of an educational hack - if you can't integrate your forums into the classroom so I can post or look at responses directly from the quiz then dont have the quizes in the first place. Due to the classes being independent they did not integrate that well (eg Python classes not combining knowledge) and there was even some repetition. There is no final 'grand unifying class', leaving me with just this short rather underwhelming class at the end. Some of the teachers are not well chosem (their delivery is just not very confident or engaging compared to good teachers). The classes were all pretty gentle introductions and rather shallow,  which is nice for breadth but I am notconvinced is enough to actually land a job. Having more 'mini-projects' would probably be better since I had to look a lot up for the final projects. Lastly, I really see no reason to pay for a nanodegree (my company paid for me) rather than take free Coursera classes (though some of these like the R one seem better)."	2016-08-27T01:19:18.271Z	4677999078

The first and foremost of them being the projects (which I think is highly advertised) and their reviews. In my opinion, they follow a prescribed set of guidelines and if your submission falls outside of that prescription, you will have to continuously revise. Even if we assume that is right, some of the things the reviewers will point out is outright wrong. I have also noticed some incorrect information in lectures. If you point something out, it will get swept under the carpet. The attention you get is at best ""C"" grade. I have had to wait more than a day with some questions that I have asked Udacity staff. Another very important aspect is the quality of the projects - they are archaic. Some of them are so obsolete that I am ashamed to put on my Linkedin. Once I have enough to list, the Udacity projects will be the first I axe from my Linkedin. I will strongly recommend to invest your time and money with edX. I have invested last 10 months, so I will probably stick until the end. One last thing is they are a for-profit business, so always take their word with a pinch of salt. They are trying to profit out of each and every venture. One of such example is this so-called career expo ""Intersect"". I am not sure how many students will attend this event considering the exorbitant expenses - it is ludicrous.

I think it would be pretty challenging for someone with no programming knowledge, though. Quality of the materials is very high, except in the last couple of sections where the videos and text were not always consistent (Android changes every year, so it's probably tough to keep everything up to date ;-)	2017-02-25T00:55:02.377Z	9896651600

It has given me the much needed prerequisites for Android Development chapter for my life, and with the given knowledge i shall plough through to the end with the help of Udacity + Google.

If you get stuck, you get help from the mentors and on the forum which means that you will succeed in the end. The reviewers do a good job too and are ready to give you good advice on you code.	2017-01-23T20:16:45.058Z	8614055487

Right from the start, all the materials, exercises and task were very well structured and easy to understand. The real world analogies and examples for building apps with purpose were one of the most interesting ways of learning I've ever experienced. 

Of course, there were some road bumps with difficult concepts and new unfamiliar things along the way but here comes the role of the amazing community (in the forums and the slack channels). When you get stuck, just ask for help. 

I'm glad that I took this ND not just because I know now a lot more about the process of developing apps for Android but also because during these 5 and a half months, this course helped me to stay focused on something I really wanted to learn about. 

I've done this comparison a couple of times before but I have to mention it again: It was like playing a video game for me. I am a gamer! I love playing games on my PS4 and while taking this course I found myself feeling exactly like gaming... I would finish a lesson or project and then I would want more. I would want to see what's behind the next door, the next level. It kind of hooks you up ( to the point that I was using almost all of my spare time to study).

I'm looking now to the next chapter in the Android Developer Nanodegree.

Thank you, Udacity!

While you can enroll classes for free, the Nanodegree deserves it's money. Reviewers did more than they were supposed to do, for example answering questions not so related to specific projects, but to android programming in general. And I must say that the answers were well documented. And there are a lot of other resources that someone could use. I was quite on budget and had to finish it in one month so didn't had so much time to spend on forums, etc., but the community is very helpful. I stick to my opinion that this one is the best android basic course that a beginner could get.	2016-11-22T11:59:19.127Z	8405665269

It draws on a full palette of all kinds of approaches to help you getting the stuff in your head, properly done and well memorized: real people talking to you, visualizing the concepts you work with by using color, images, metaphors, sounds and gestures, letting you practice what you learned and providing helpful links to supporting documentation and information and a personal tutor. A positive learning experience that not only is fun but also gets you doing all the work that needs to be done. You don't have to wait long for the first real results of your Android programming.

So far I love this Nanodegree. They really do a great job of giving you a great amount of knowledge online. I have done some online classes in the past at ASU while I was getting my degree, and it was not done well. The instructors are very easy to understand and the explanations in this program are well done. 
Keep in mind not all of the information will be spoon fed to you, so some google searching will be necessary in order to take full advantage of this program. 
The last App is pretty intense and took me about 2 weeks to complete, but I feel that I have a very functional knowledge of Android now and I can start making some apps on my own. "	2016-10-14T22:50:38.254Z	8683026171

I took several MOOCs and courses on Android, including the awesome TeamTreeHouse courses, but these were by far the most carefully planned and well-executed courses. And most of all, the feedback that you get from professionals on your Android Project assignments is invaluable. They review your project very carefully, giving you suggestions about what you're doing wrong and what could be further improved and also encouraging you when you perform well. 
In short, this was the most amazing experience for me, till now :)"	2016-10-06T11:33:00.888Z	5034783349

I tried other course at sites like Udemy but I didn't feel like they were delving into the concepts, and subsequently the reasons why you would do something a certain way in Java, enough and it left me with more questions than answers. This NanoDegree has been great because they explain a lot of what they are doing incrementally so as to not overwhelm while still having you engage and actually learn the material not just ""follow along"" by copying their code. I very much appreciate the guidance and the non-guidance that happens later in the NanoDegree. By that I mean that once they cover a topic they won't keep riding a dead horse and holding your hand by showing you the code. Once it's been covered (and usually very thoroughly) you can refer to it if you like or just Google it and find an answer that works for you. I really appreciate the coding challenges because it feels like I'm actually researching and coding for myself and that I have to solve the problems. The community of students and teachers is very supportive as well and are always open to helping out in the cases where you do get stuck. Overall, I would highly recommend this NanoDegree to anyone wanting to learn Android. It was developed by Google after all."	2016-09-26T18:27:57.698Z	8989913465

All concepts of Native Android Development ranging from very easy to very difficult are explained in an amazing way, that it is very easy to understand, absorb, implement and carry with you to new projects.

The very-well balanced variance between instructors' hand-holding and stepping-back carefully moves you from ""How on earth can I do that?"" to ""Wow, I have done it!"".

I would recommend this nanodegree to anyone taking on android development aside of their previous programming knowledge."	2016-09-08T14:07:24.330Z	u8926169

Some lessons did you leave you feel a bit lost but you had to definitely rewatch and do extra outside work from the website to get directions. The API course hits you like a brick or at least it did for me. This certificate is definitely a good basics but don't expect to be an expert or be making the next flappy birds because that is totally out of the scope of this lesson. 	2017-02-11T01:43:56.925Z	8655862644

I'll split my opinion in three:
1- Good points:
 - very well organised
- a good team in the back of it to support you if you need help
- it is approachable for someone who've never been in coding before
- I believe it's the best online platform at the moment
2- Better if:
- it was more focussed on introducing Java language
- there were more moderators online on the chat(60-70 of the online appointments are made for silly things which can be fixed in a few minutes)
-some of the videos would be shorter and the usually ""problem makers""/ the important elements of coding would've had more attention given
Suggestions to the new students:
- Find a mentor in your personal life, to bother him with some questions time to time. It will help you a lot
- do a free Java online course for beginners - it will help you a lot too
 I would definitely do the ""Android Developer"" course from Udacity too, in the near future."	2016-12-09T21:00:44.671Z	8733470630

I am excited to learn more and watch more lessons each day. The instructors make the subject matter seem easy and doable even thought its complicated.  Their sense of humor and their encouraging comments make me want to learn and develop more. I also like the interviews from the Google engineers. They are better than my university professors.

However, as much as I love the degree and getting the credentials at the end of the course, I doubt that I will continue. This is because I find the $199 per month pricing a little expensive for my budget. The documentation says it takes users usually about 12 month to complete, this means the fee sums up to $2400 at the end of the course.  In addition, unlike the Nano Degree plus, this degree does not guarantee or even give hopes for job opportunities. Therefore, paying $2400 just for the credential is a little expensive (Since watching the videos are free.)

But please say Thank your for me the the instructors!

However - some of the more recently released lessons (networking and databases/storage) feel a little rough around the edges. For example, I'll notice multiple times that videos will reference linked materials which are in fact not linked. There are occasional typos or mistakes in the videos that should have been caught by anyone proof-watching these videos. While the overall content of the course is excellent, these items make the later materials feel rushed and sloppy. At $200/month, this isn't acceptable unfortunately.	2016-10-10T03:29:42.955Z	u11148245

Project reviews are awesome because you'll be able to see how other people look at your code and find mistakes that sometimes you won't be able to notice. That being said, be aware that not all reviewers can review your project passionately and provides exceptional suggestions and find mistakes accurately. The project resources mostly came from Android Developers website which mostly covers everything you need to know about Android development. Sometimes, the instructors will give you pro tips to speed up development process which is quite helpful. The courses are fun, interactive, and practical. I like how they use GitHub to host the course projects and code snippets because that reflects the way developers collaborate with each other in a real work scenario.	2016-08-09T17:47:43.668Z	6839566929

When there is people paying 200$ a month, you better get top end material.  Especially if the nanodegree is not highly respected yet.  I do compliment the prep course material for a project as you will have live eyes to look at your work and judge.  However, in between I find myself constantly looking at other material just to knock out a section.  I understand they are teaching methods to correctly search for solutions as that is part of the job.  However, when I am researching on what the instructor just did tends to really frustrate me.  Currently, I work on servers and networking including configurations for routers and switches, so this comes easier to me then most.  I still have a ways to go, but I am far behind in terms with the time they estimate to complete this course (i.e. takes 8.5 hours to complete, when I took much longer).	2016-10-14T02:54:36.608Z	9631008537

I would recommend this to all my colleagues.

But, by far the greatest advantage is the awesome feedback I've received for each of my project submissions. When revision was needed, I was given resources to further my studies so that I learned what, why and how to bring my project up to standard. This is better than a traditional university experience. I've learned more about machine learning and pytnon in two months, than a year and a half of graduate school. Don't get me wrong, I needed the graduate school to bring my writing, analytical, and math skills up to par, but the MLND has taught me how to put it all together. 	2016-12-28T15:45:30.240Z	1225958907

This is the best way to learning the most and faster with the key learning materials. Most of reviewers are really trying to give additional information on top of feedback on what has been wrong. Also, instead of ambiguously stating what can be improved, they give a working example code that I can start modyfing and learn from.

Nanodegree program is exhaustive and you learn material that you would learn in a graduate study program. In fact, the people teaching the courses and running the program are graduates from the world's flagship universities such as Stanford. The Career Preparation is exhaustive: linkedin, cover letter, resume, and technical interview questions. During my time in the program, the Udacity refined the projects (added a few more) and now the Nanodegree is without a doubt is sterling silver.

But I would suggest to get something better or make the video's interactive which are done by Charles and Michael. They really go in too deep which sometimes doesn't make sense or just confuse the concepts. There is a vast difference in the videos done by Katie and sebastian and then these guys. For most of the stuff taught by them, I had to either look up on udacity forums or google it. They really messed up my mind at some points. So that's the only thing I didn't like and needs a big improvement. Everything other than these are just perfect. Including some more projects will make the course really good.

At the beginning of this course, I never would have imagined how engaging this course would be.  I had my doubts about how I would connect with other students and Udacity teachers.  I must say that I felt more engaged than any of my courses that I've attended at University.  I was also not enthusiastic of the forums for asking questions and helping others but, in the end, I found this medium to be a saviour.  Hearing about other people's challenges, helping others and getting input from others gave me that extra push to move forward.   	2016-09-22T21:02:30.342Z	5611528707

P.S. My experience with student support was not the best. This is the content of my last formal email with a lady from student support:

Dearest (lady's name),

Every case is different and this is not about who wins the argument. This is about being fair.
I am passing my case to Udacity support requesting them to pass my case to the Udacity Student Service Representative or to your supervisor or whoever is above him/her. If necessary I would be glad to contact the founders of Udacity.
Does your decision with my case really reflect the image, goals, mission and values of Udacity?

Nowhere in the goals and mission of Udacity it says that the Machine Learning programs and benefits limit to a specific country.
The founders' wish is to make the information available for any student no matter what is our location. Any of us could do something good for all in the world. They are clear:

""Our mission is to bring accessible, affordable, engaging, and highly effective higher education to the world. We believe that higher education is a basic human right, and we seek to empower our students to advance their education and careers.."". Link: https://www.udacity.com/us

""So that everyone in the world can become a self-driving [in this case Machine Learning] engineer"" (from the Udacity video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9z-eKD2xjk [0:37-0:45]).

Some information about the founders:

1) Sebastian Thrun (born May 14, 1967) is an innovator, entrepreneur educator, and computer scientist from Germany. He was CEO and cofounder of Udacity. Before that, he was a Google VP and Fellow, and a Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University. At Google, he founded Google X. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Thrun).

2) David Stavens, second cofounder: ""Welcome. I am the founding CEO and current President/COO of Udacity. ... I received a PhD in Computer Science from Stanford, advised by Sebastian Thrun."" (http://ai.stanford.edu/~dstavens/)

3) The last cofounder of Udacity: Mike believes technology should make life better, not more complicated. Previously he worked in robotics at Stanford University and the University of Alberta, and studied at Carnegie Mellon University. Autonomous vehicles, medical robotics, reinforcement learning, and robotic soccer populate his past. Mike Sokolsky (https://www.crunchbase.com/person/mike-sokolsky)

And their mission does not stop there. But their desire is to help financially-worldwide students like me who have the ability and determination to finish the program before the 12-months.
Once again, I did not make use of any of the extra resources/benefits from the Nanodegree Plus Program. And if what you stated regarding the I-9 form had been clear from the start I would have never ever contacted nor talked to you asking you to switch me to the traditional Nanodegree program. I would have enrolled in the traditional Nanodegree program from the start.
In any case (Plus or traditional program) I am finishing the program before the 12 months. I did not make use of the extra services from the Plus program. Rachel Higgins is aware of it. Furthermore, the purpose of the traditional Nanodegree policy of giving 50% tuition back is to help students who need financial assistance, like me. And you are denying me that benefit which innately belongs to me because the information provided to me was not clear and complete from the start. That is unfair. Rules exits to make sure that the mission statement and goals are always accomplished. Do what is right.

Regards,
-Andrea"	2016-08-11T20:41:08.896Z	4433134800

I`m very  satisfied with participating in MLE Nanodegree program! But a one small thing is and that a little-bit decrease my satisfaction. The materials at the end of  the program are not very useful or not easy understandable due to small number of explanations/examples and also they are too static (~5min with single frame image). In comparison with materials prepared by S.Thrun they are in poor quality. Although, I think this is not very large gap due the course started first time and in the feature many materials will be improved and expanded!
Thank you!

The teaching methodology goes beyond the video classes and the projects, and actually encourages the students to seek extra material to study, and to reason from the information shared during the courses. 
There is a very interesting and effective balance regarding the theoretical classes between Georgia Tech's and Udacity contents. The part of the material presented by Professor Thrun and Katie Malone has a more practical nature and really encourages you to explore the tools to accomplish the best results, in contrast with Georgia Tech's material that has a profound theoretical root but really encourages scientific thinking, and addresses complex topics in a relaxed way .
I'm really satisfied with the program. Mainly because it goes beyond to teach to simply knowing how to implement algorithms and teaches all the necessary care of a prior data exploration something that many professionals do not pay attention nowadays and it is important if you desire a satisfactory result.
 I recommend, and I would do another nanodegrees in the future."	2016-06-15T12:24:10.989Z	3380548776

The coursework marking is personal and insightful and gives you good feedback on how to improve. My only criticism is that the course 'flow' could do with a bit of polishing as it can jump around a bit, but for a first iteration it works well enough.	2016-02-04T09:39:06.481Z	4764938612

Have been interested in Machine learning for about 2 years, but  got sincere only 6 months back. Tried some other courses and read few blogs on learning ML and got to know about Kaggle and read through Field Guide to Data Science by Booz Allen. All this formed an idea about what a good learning path in ML could look like. 

This is when I came across this Machine Learning Nano Degree. This was my first serious attempt at learning AI. I was excited at the beginning, but then soon it became dense. Simply watching course videos was not satisfying, and I got confused. But after a day or two in confusion, I decided to push ahead and came across other material within Udacity, like Statistics courses, and a course on Introduction to Machine Learning. I took time to complete these before moving ahead with this Nano Degree. This filled gaps in my understanding of concepts. Although some videos refer to phantom / missing material, which could be confusing at times, but I go through those anyways even if these don't make much sense at that time; and then return later after understanding other concepts or after reading some materials available offline. I refer 2 books - ""An Introduction to Statistical Learning with applications in R"" and ""The Elements of Statistical Learning"".

The project, forum, and feedback from mentors are pure gold, I'd say. Course videos give direction and some understanding, which we need to explore on our own. Quiz are really effective at reinforcing our understanding in the easiest way possible. 

Hope to finish this within 6 -8 months, and then move to Data Sciences  Nano Degree.

P.S. I compare notes with other I know who are learning ML or are working in this field, and I think am on right track."	2016-01-11T17:02:28.157Z	2628298569

The ability to work through challenging and interesting projects, rather than just watching videos and answering quiz questions, really helps to drive the material home.  But the best part is the capstone project at the end, which allows me to really go out and challenge myself and to get feedback on my work.  That's the key difference between this program and others, including self-study - solid, helpful, encouraging and useful feedback from people who know what they're talking about.  For prospective students, be prepared to work hard - to do reading outside the course videos, lots of coding, etc.  This is a serious program that requires serious effort, but the reward is serious fun!	2016-01-11T14:39:01.570Z	u163684

It is a great resource for anybody who wants to learn about many details on the topic, including supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement and deep learning. 

Professors are very motivated on teaching and lectures are fun, besides really easy to understand. Additionally, Udacity's resources like forums, 1:1 appointments, blogs and others really help students  with different personalized alternatives on how to learn better. Furthermore, it is great that they're constantly updating the course so that new students have the best of all experiences. 

The only downside I can tell is that while the course covers many topics, sometimes the lectures don't go too in depth. This is obvious, since it is not focused for scientists but engineering, and application is the main focus. Nevertheless a bit more of math is helpful to understand where do each model come from."	2016-12-21T02:35:44.595Z	9048700251

The first dozens of lessons where you are tasked with manually computing standard deviations must be a joke, right?  Plug-and-chug never taught anyone anything.  The profs Charles and Michael spend a lot of time in their videos joking around, which is entertaining, but if I wanted to be entertained I'd go play video games.  I wish there was an option to speed up the videos like with coursera, as a lot of the videos are just way too basic and a waste of time for the most part.  The best part is the hands-on coding, which is where you will actually learn to do something.  Unfortunately, they don't teach a single thing about distributed computing (Spark, Hadoop, etc), which I think is an essential part of the future of machine learning and data science.  I'm finding it hard to work with big data using Python alone, and am finding I need to teach myself Apache Spark, which isn't easy.	2016-08-14T00:53:55.322Z	8545536610

I've taken other online courses and found the lectures to be far superior to Charles and Michael's.  When you have a platform where your videos are played over and over again by thousands of students, you should be precise, specific, and easy to understand.  They were all over the place, and it seemed like they just thought of everything on the spot.  Their verboseness, tangential conversation, and lack of clarity made it hard to learn.  Half the words they said were distractions from the subjects they were attempting to teach.  In fact, I often just went to Wikipedia to learn the topics they taught and found it much more easy to understand. 

I found the other lectures/quizzes to be helpful.  Sebastian and Katie were good teachers who effectively taught the subject matter.  The projects and feedback on the projects are great.  Those are what really helped me learn the subject matter.  The capstone on deep learning was really cool.

An example is the first project which changed from a python script project to an ipython project. Moreover, this is evident by looking at the iterations that were released and changes in the design of each project. If you compare the quality of solution that previous Nanodegree students produced, later iterations of the course are watered down. Previous students produced extremely advanced visualizations. A simple google search will provide evidence at the difference in quality. At the moment, the smartcab project is broken and no solution is in sight from the moderators or the designers. In fact, the forums are ridden with complaints about users not being to set up the environments needed to run the scripts (hopefully, later the ND will make these into ipython projects rather than just scripts). I'm lucky that I know what I'm doing, but of all the projects, the smartcab is the Achiles' heel in the ND. Avoid this fairly new Nanodegree for the moment. If you want to see if the MLND is fixed, checkout the source files on github before enrolling. Another note, the Portfolio development of this Nanodegree, and perhaps others, takes the employers to which you're applying and informs other ND users to apply to the same employer, thus creating competition for yourself. I noticed that Udacity updated their employment listing after I told them where I applied. This was infuriating! Be warned enrolling in this relatively new ND. The product is still stabilizing and users should avoid paying a premium for a product that is essentially changing from Beta to a working product.	2016-08-23T19:23:03.832Z	5509519502

I am an undergraduate student of computer science, interested in artificial intelligence.  I took Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning course on Coursera and thought that a Udacity Nano-degree would be an updated and practical next step.  

I was horrified to discover that the material in this nano-degree is markedly worse than that of Andrew Ng’s course, despite the fact that his is free compared to a $200/month fee and the recency of this program.  The nano-degree consists essentially of two otherwise free courses and a few projects.  The courses are disjointed and poorly taught, leaving gaps of critical information while wasting unbelievable amounts of time on quiz questions requiring the calculation of an average by hand.  

The projects are poorly constructed and juvenile, and each submission I made was met with a reviewer that could not properly apply the rubric.  I would spend more time outlining the grading standards to the reviewer than actually completing my projects.  

Perhaps worst of all were the constant ‘growing pains’ evident as course content kept changing while I was working through the course and as referenced resources were unavailable.  In one case, I had to turn to Google to find the appropriate download for a project.

I could not in good faith recommend this nano-degree to anyone, regardless of their objectives.  It is too juvenile for someone with an existing understanding or background in the field yet too disjointed for someone unfamiliar with the field.  Given the advertising that had brought me to this program in the first place, I am now forced to assume that all Udacity nano-degrees are of similar quality.  

I will continue to view courses for free on your platform, because I am firmly interested in this field.  But you will never take another dollar from me."	2016-07-25T18:58:44.688Z	4388089134

Excellent course structure. I haven't come across many introductory courses which gives you a strong foundation in more than one languages. This course is an excellent source for someone from non coding background like designers, business people etc. to learn programming in modern languages like javascript and python. Fantastic. Incredible. Winner! 	2017-02-11T13:09:21.145Z	5393874345

Your computer illiterate <insert older relative here e.g. grandfather or grandmother> could take this course and become better coders than many undergraduates.

If you've taken a few semesters of computer science courses or have a little bit of practical experience with programming, I'd suggest to attempt finishing the course materials on trial.  Project 1 is about building a simple webpage with html and css.  Project 2 is the typical intro to programming project mainly testing your knowledge of functions (in Python) and loops.  Project 3 is about classes (with a ridiculously easy project that should take most people 10-15  minutes).  The final project in the full-stack path is basically writing a few lines of sql (and is barely longer/harder than project 3).

My biggest advice for the students who like to go the extra mile, is don't.  Don't look at extreme cases.  Don't attempt to include any additional features.  Just don't!  I spent 8 hours on project 0 trying to implement certain features without looking anything up.  In reality, I had met the requirements at the 30 minute mark.  If your program meets all the specifications, just submit."	2016-12-07T01:39:36.554Z	117898160

It certainly needs a lot of hard works in reading through many information. This includes not only the instructor's videos and manuals, but also many more links of information from reading through discussion forum, referred from mentors, posted summary notes, and recorded videos. In my case, I have input a lot of time in it and much more than just 20 hours a week. But because I have interest in programming and liked this course, I was enjoying doing it. There are times where things seems to be frustrating and impossible, but the key is to look up, be at rest and in peace, and realize that all information needed is right there (sources mentioned above). The great resource I have found for most of the questions I had was the discussion forum. If I couldn't get any answer from there, then my 2nd option always was posting my questions on the forum. The mentors and couches are excellent and very prompt to answer all your questions and usually they will go extra giving you more information using links. So I didn't need to have a 1-2-1 appointment at all. In my opinion, practicing and doing all in the instruction manuals every day is a must to be successful in gaining real knowledge and programming skill. Also, whenever I had any technical issue or general question in locating something, the technical staffs were very prompt in providing the needed information by responding to my e-mail.  Finally, for students who have a plan to take this course, my advice to them is to make themselves familiar with these programming languages (HTML, CSS, java script, python) in advance.  Thank a lot Udacity!	2016-11-25T13:31:30.832Z	7962047367

I wanted a new career and went through the myriad of choices I could choose from to pursue.  Computers are a staple in my family, in fact, my grandfather worked for IBM for 35 years (and passed away at 92 this summer) and holds the original patent on magnetic disk drives.  I like analytical thinking and problem solving, the job market is booming, I could perform this career in relative perpetuity (my current job can be VERY physical... don't get me started on explaining how we use the deli slicer), and I could relocate or work remotely - all very important aspects I was reviewing.  I began studying computer science this summer with some haphazard help from my brother and cousin who work as a UX developer and a Java programmer respectively.  My brother shoved some books my way and said ""you might start here.""  One was an HTML book, the other CCS.  I quickly learned that I hate web development and picked up a book in Python programming.  I tried a couple of other online programs (codeschool I think was one), but the instruction was all over the place and didn't tie ideas together cogently.  I was just starting to learn Python when I found out that I didn't get into the post-baccalaureate program that I wanted to enroll in.  I promptly decided that it wouldn't hold me back and I began digging into other methods of achieving my goal.  I noticed something interesting on WGU's (another CS school I was interested in) website that a nanogdegree from Udacity was an acceptable prerequisite for their program.  I looked at Udacity and realized that they have a well-put-together program.  I'm midway through the Intro to Programming nanodegree and I'm really excited about what I am learning.  Sometimes, I feel that I could be moving faster with the content, but I noticed that there is a lot of emphasis placed on how things work in Python and in computers in general, which is something that I hadn't seen in other resources.  To me, this understanding is crucial.  I also like the quizzes.  Sometimes I wish there were even more, but they give me a little bit of interactive learning in good intervals.  I recently was discussing my experiences with Udacity with a friend who works in tech support.  Originally, he said it sounded like a scam.  I sent him the company info and now he's planning on starting a nanodegree as well - he was that impressed with the content and supporters of the programs.

Looking back, I'm glad I didn't get into the university program I had applied to.  I know that I wouldn't have gotten the level of understanding about the things I wanted to learn (which was a major issue I had with my first undergrad degree).  I'm also saving close to $30K (more if you consider interest - probably closer to $50-60K), and can study at my own pace.  I understand that being able to transition to a new career without a CS degree may be a little more challenging and take a little longer, but overall it's a much wiser decision for me.  

I'm really excited about the last section of this nanodegree.  I was really lost when I looked at all of the avenues that I could take in pursuing a new career in programming.  It's really helpful to get my feet wet in a few different types of programming and compare my experiences with industry needs and income expectations!

Thank you so much guys!"	2016-10-08T21:57:07.167Z	7323892042

I was skeptical at first, since the program is completely online. This program was really fun! I got great feedback on my projects too. I felt challenged and I know that the skills I learned will translate to future studies and work. This Nanodegree is a great first step for anyone looking to find their niche in programming.

So, I would honestly like to thank the entire udacity team responsible for this nanodegree, and in general, responsible for udacity, for giving me some confidence to learn again.

The videos are cut into small chunks so they are easy to digest, you also see the progress which is motivating.

Other online courses are often taught in traditional classrooms and the instructor can sometimes be patronizing without realizing it. Also, there is feedback which is both timely and relevant. My only concern personally is that the scope of the subjects is still limited but I believe will become more broad as Udacity grows. My other concern with some online courses is that a student may be interested in many courses and could use some counseling as to which course they choose as well as assistance creating an across-course learning map.	2016-07-29T01:22:35.871Z	5831748782

If you're like me never had any coding experience, this program is for you. 
I have learned a lot. I have learned how actually and cleared all my ideas about programming at all. This is helping me to choose my programming path easier.
Of course I won't just rely on the only material provided and will just look around for more info. I really like the way they teach how to look and where to look for things that you should be interested in. 
I truly believe this concept of learning is the future!

Students learn by listening instructors, watching participating in webinars and forums. And also making projects that would go into their portfolio. Curriculum embraces many lines of development of IT industry. Finally one can chose which one is the best for him (or her) to work. I am the sort of learning the hard way, but I come to like this Program and the Coaches. Learning is tough but people are nice, helpful and understanding.	2016-02-04T01:29:40.398Z	u25473472

Pro's:
* Practical approach: real sense that Udacity wants every student to become an employable programmer
* Effective: well thought-out curriculum, which (so far) builds up the student's confidence with a good mixture of (video) ""lecture"", text notes, follow-along examples, and do-it-yourself.  Some theory, but focus on practical.
* Self-paced: the do-it-yourself builds confidence one step at a time, but is not so simple to be boring.
* Good help: weekly office hours and good support.  
* Individual attention: it's clear that the Reviewers go through students' code line-by-line, offering helpful feedback in comments.
* Clean, easy-to-use online 'classroom': basically, you follow a ""path"", which is the course syllabus and clearly shows the key deliverables at each Stage (there are five stages).
* Breadth and practical depth.  (Caveat: as an Intro student, by definition I don't know what I don't know, but here's my impression).  I like that the IPND covers a practical breadth of topics, with enough depth in each to be useful.. HTML, CSS, Python, and then you get to choose where to focus for Stage 5 (API's, Javascript, Responsive...)

Cons:
* I think Udacity could do a better job fostering a sense of community within a Cohort.   
* The historic Office Hours videos are useful, but it would be nice to be able to flag information that is outdated (content evolves from 2015 to 2016 versions, so the answers are no longer accurate, in some cases)."	2016-02-01T13:16:14.984Z	6532948937

It is ideal for absolute beginners who now nothing about programming yet and have no idea what to learn, where to start. The course not only will show you whether you are the right person for this kind of job but it will also give you a knowledge about next possibilities - where to continue after finishing the nanodegree. As a graduate, maybe you will not be interesting for many employers yet, but you will be able to do simple projects, know what to learn and where to look for information you need for your projects.	2016-01-29T07:36:16.863Z	4327977990

In college I began as a CompSci major and have always had a passion for coding. I've taken other udacity courses and they were top notch so I decided to enroll in the Intro To Programming nanodegree.

The experience so far has been excellent! One great thing I've noticed is that here at udacity they really emphasize how to actually think as a programmer. The instructors are top notch, and the format is clear, concise, and relevant. The code reviews for projects are super-detailed, and I really want to thank my reviewers for putting in the time to correct my mistakes and teach me how to be a better programmer. 

Although I do have previous coding experience in C, Python, I had never used HTML or CSS. Within the first two weeks, I was stoked to be able to create an html site that actually looked pretty good! I've never been the super artistic type (although I love music) but I really enjoyed the artistic element of creating and styling a site with CSS from scratch. 

I highly recommend this nanodegree to anyone who is looking for an introduction to programming. I've already decided that once I finish this nanodegree I'm enrolling for another right away!"	2016-01-26T23:50:00.923Z	6309668539

The support and help I received from fellow classmates and mentors are great. Everything seems to work well in the program and hopefully this will help me land a great job in the future.

I have always wanted to get into computer science and coding, but did not have the time and money to invest in a credited school. Udacity has given me an alternative to that."	2016-01-13T05:38:03.299Z	710089494

I never really appreciated technology until I took this course. After completing this Nanodegree, I found I had a new passion for programming, and a strong foundation of knowledge that could be built upon. Then I pursued interviewed in Seattle for a Cloud Support role with Amazon Web Services. Two days later, I was offered an entry level position as a Junior support engineer. 

Keep in mind that the INPD course does not prepare you specifically for this role, or teach you how to interview with Amazon. I did extensive research before going into this pursuit. But the skills I learned from Udacity greatly paid off during the technical portion of my interview. Udacity taught me how to think like a developer, and how to break down big problems into small problems. If you have no experience in software development, and looking for a shift in your career towards something that is globally rising fast, then I strongly recommend starting here. You won't regret the learning experience and you never know what could be in front of you tomorrow."	2016-01-12T19:27:44.289Z	4711949288

Since I did not know anything about programming I needed a course where it would start from the ground and work my way up, that is just where this course started. They have instilled many avenues for students to learn, it can be anything from instructor feed back (which is quick and very informative and will give you places to go to see answers),  to student forums, and even work sessions with the instructors.  Since I have started and now about 1/2 way through the course I can say that I am looking forward to the next course and ready to learn!	2016-01-11T20:28:57.953Z	5245485772

It tries to avoid people freaking out with bunch of codes at the start. Udacity provides fairly enough starter codes and guide through the process. The material are presented in an intuitive way instead of developing solid computer science theory. So, if you want to learn coding ""happily"", this program is great for you. If you prefer a more hardcore approach, I would suggest taking a normal ""Intro to CS"" courses on Coursera or edx and other web-development courses. 

Overall, the quality of the material is nice. Projects got reviewed within a day. The discussion platform is not really active. So you definitely need google and stackoverflow (doing your own research is also what the program encourages)."	2016-08-17T06:36:46.157Z	4382611890

I really wasn't expecting the optional elective portion of the course to be mandatory to graduate the nano degree but maybe I missed something. I was planning on taking the next class anyway but I thought I might get a little break! haha Oh well! lets keep it going! If you guys really want people to succeed, I think Udacity is doing everything right. When I tell people about the monthly tuition the response is usually negative. Then I just tell them how it's probably a much better system than a lump sum paid upfront, the sooner you complete the program, the less you pay and you get half of your money back! SO I finished the last project today and it met specifications. I got excited and then boom. Oh snap I have another project. I already knew I wanted to do the front-end class next. So whatever, I chose that path/project so this is ultimately on me. This class starts out with a zip file you can download from git-hub or work in the forked repository and branch it to your own fork that you then edit within a master file that you need to give a reason for editing and you don't really know what you're changing and it all makes total sense because we used git-hub this whole time NOT. It says if you don't have experience with git-hub then no worries! You can just download the zip file and open the java files in a text editor. Here is how the videos start once you get going. They show you 2 windows in a text editor, one with the main HTML portion, and another to write java. Their java window is nice and color coded and I'm jealous because a simple text editor won't show you any indication of error or correct entries. Like a color for var and another for .log. So you're stuck with figuring out how to either learn git-hub before you can really start, or figure out where you're supposed to be writing the code. One of the videos has the resume HTML on the left, and the java resume code on the right. Then the screen on the right changes to the ""java helpers file"" window and all the guy says is ""Through the magic of computers we get to this window"". Everything started out smoothly then I thought ""okay if I'm going to get comfy in this new chapter I need to figure out what is going on."" I could tell you how long it took me to find a nice place to code but then I would just be embarrassing myself. "	2016-07-23T05:23:43.895Z	6886254326

One being that the final project was primarily done step by step in the class. I would of preferred to have flexed my brain and cemented my recently acquired knowledge by having to create and implement my own classes in new project. Secondly, the project used fresh_tomatoes.py heavily. It was important for me to learn how to use others code, but that was the bulk of the assignment and it contained a lot of JavaScript and Bootstrap which made it intimidating to really edit much. I think the project was definitely fun, but would like a better/different assignment added to the end.	2016-07-23T02:23:58.481Z	3186048606

The only negative critique I'd give right now is in Unit 2, where there seems to be leaps in skill knowledge to concepts that were not so thoroughly fleshed out--specifically concerning while loops. In other words, scaffolding of the instruction is clear, but some steps were skipped for in order for me t understand what was expected for creating the Madlibs Generator. So it felt less comprehensive by the time I had to code it.  I repeated the unit twice to grasp it all.	2016-07-20T20:18:15.423Z	6996500457

The best part is that after learning the basics the program gives you options as to which type of programming might be best for you (i.e. front-end, iOS, android development).

There obviously some things that need improvement, but I'm pretty darn happy because I have a working webapp I've created.

I enrolled in the Introduction to Programming Nanodegree Program because it not only would allow me to find some answers (Is Computer Science the right field for me?), but would allow me to deal with a slightly unpredictable work schedule.  I know a decent amount about programming (I taught myself BASIC when I was a child, and have coded in a few other languages), but I wanted to have a better idea of what I'd be signing up for, if I really were to change my career, and this Nanodegree program really helped me in this regard.

You still need to have some self discipline to get your work done rather than putting it off.

Most of it was easy to understand and follow.  There were times where I had to keep playing back videos in order to actually see what was coded because things moved to fast.  Also, the parts that were used from other courses kept making comments that without the prior knowledge of the course confused me at times.	2016-01-24T23:23:23.132Z	3408458648

I know Andy always had his notes there to take us through the stages, and help us focus, but sometimes I really wish that there was one instructor to break down the topics.  I understand why this program is this way, but at times I did yearn for a little bit more coherence. 

But the reviewers are super helpful, and will make sure you get where you need to with your project submissions (and then turn them around really fast!) The videos themselves are very easy to follow, and they breakdown some very complex topics into simple examples."	2016-01-21T01:32:50.668Z	4158428876

However I did find Lesson 2 and the way it was taught to be rather difficult to follow at times. Some of the concepts behind the loops and how to effectively use them weren't explained adequately before asking us to create a solution with them, Then in the following answer the instructor would explain the concept that was needed to solve the problem but only after asking you to solve it with said information. That style of learning is new programmer prohibitive as it makes the quiz questions exceedingly difficult to answer at times.	2016-01-17T23:27:56.678Z	5827909896

I have taken online courses before, but not for programming. Based on my experience, the video lectures and quizzes are well-prepared and are challenging enough for any beginner. However, I believe the most valuable perk of the program is the lightning-quick feedback that a user receives upon submitting assignments and projects. These experts not only provide encouraging compliments on my work, but also strive to critique my work in a positive way that allows me to expand my knowledge and work capacity. I am also extremely excited about the opportunity to receive half of my tuition back upon completing the Nanodegree within ONE year! Overall, I am very satisfied with my experience using Udacity for online education, but I would have loved if they had a system to measure progress, possibly through a visual demonstration of completion percentage. I think that it motivates beginners, like myself, to keep pushing when we are able to see how far we've come. Other than that, I am very happy with my decision to go with Udacity for online education! Thanks, Udacity! -Satisfied Customer from Pigeon, MI	2016-01-12T22:34:25.472Z	5728700202

However, the python lessons were really confusing. It seemed like there was a substantial amount of definition and logic missing which made the lessons hard to follow. I always felt like I had missed something in the modules and watched them many times over. Eventually just to understand why I was using certain codes and functions I had to go to a lesson plan by a different company.	2016-02-12T20:59:36.807Z	5475199982

I went through a lot of useful things and tried to catch all the information, but sometimes it would get frustrating because I was expected to submit a mini project (like def function or so) where I would have no idea how to combine what I've learned and create that mini project.
My husband is a software engineer and he gave an opinion that it wasn't a good choice to introduce programming basics based on Python to a beginner like me who knows nothing about programming. 
I would understand what instructor is explaining and how it works, but when it comes to a quiz I will be stuck when it gets harder. I'm a little bit disappointed with this course/Udacity, especially because I paid for it, but I'll give it another chance by taking one more course.

As I went through it, I think it may have been in beta and there were several changes that were made after I had completed sections, so it is a good thing that someone is listening. My major issue was one of context. Several, if not all of the segments seem to be associated with other courses and many times they lacked some clarifying context which they had in their regular course. Case in point, there are many segments of the Computer Science course which overlap, but the Computer Science course has extra stuff that gives the material more context and makes it somewhat easier to understand.	2016-01-12T19:33:34.937Z	4064048600

Stage 0 and Stage 1 were basic and fun. I learned a lot about HTML and the projects forced me to summarize what I learned, which really reinforced my learning.

Stage 2 and Stage 3 were bad. Although it's true that I'd taken 2 basic comp sci courses at my university, I still have to say that these two stages went unbelievably slowly, stretching out simple concepts into many, many videos. In Stage 2, we were forced to write the most basic of loops over and over again. I almost cried of boredom. It's only saving grace is the Quiz project, which forced me to be a better programmer. In Stage 3, the mini-projects and Project felt like copy-and-paste wastes of time.

Stage 4 was an overview of the many paths, which could have been condensed into 1 short pdf instead of and hour of videos. The project shouldn't have been called a project. Not a good stage.

Stage 5 - I did the Data Analyst path. This was a bad course, which has left me with a bad taste in my mouth at the end of this Nanodegree. The instructor spends her time throwing new python, numPy, and pandas syntax/constructs at you, and then asks you to use them once or twice. It feels so DISJOINTED. Most of the things she teaches don't feel related to each other or to an overall goal. As you follow along, you feel like a code monkey, not like a data analyst.

So at the end of this course, I got to write a lot of code in Python (although much of it a bit trivial). I got to pretend to be a Data Analyst, by writing code without understanding WHY I was doing any of it. This Nanodegree needs significant improvement, but it'll still be helpful to a complete beginner."	2016-06-26T19:58:26.606Z	8446301736

In part one you are building all of the skills needed to be able to complete and execute the project.

Não só o curso, mas a plataforma em si é impressionante, sendo rica em conteúdo e feedback (o diferencial) feito por profissionais garante que o aluno somente seguirá adiante se realmente souber por a mão na massa.

I wholeheartedly recommend your program so far and I just want to leave a note for the ones that are thinking of joining : 

It is a terrific program and you will like it BUT, just because the Udacity instructors put in a lot of effort of showing you how to do it, that does not mean you do not have to study and do some side researching/ practice on your own.

What this program does is set you on the proper path but it does not always hold your hand along the way, in other words, it really prepares you for the real world challenges. "	2017-01-22T13:55:47.382Z	8803634409

This program is really helful for those who are really into web designing and development. Udacity Nanodegree program is a very good platform to improve our coding skills. All the teachers and mentors excellent in their field and we also get to study from engineers in GOOGLE , HACK REACTOR etc. They share their experiences about writing codes and gives us advice on how to tackle problems when we face them.
There is a forum where we can post our doubts regarding the projects. The forum is a very good place to search answers. 
We get to play around with many styles and javascript libraries. This gives us a lot of exposure to various technologies and techniques available. 
I would recommend this to anyone who wants to the best in the web development field. This course helps us to build a strong foundation to our web designing and coding skills.
I  loved doing every project even though it was difficult at first. But i have to say its part of the job !!!!

Well udacity not only fulfilled all my needs but at the same time it has exceeded my expectations about online courses. I was worried about one thing that I am all by myself and I'll have to deal with problems alone and won't have anyone ask for help. But in udacity u always have help I'm one way or another. Either in forums or through 1:1 appointments help is always available in udacity for those who look and ask for it. :)	2016-11-14T05:42:34.261Z	9231346084

Not only has it provided a great foundation, but pushed me toward the right resources to deepen my knowledge on my own. Awesome stuff.	2016-11-10T21:48:48.502Z	356158618

Learning by doing is vital, and learning at Udacity is amazing. Total support on the forums, on weekdays and weekends, whenever you have a question, be sure that Udacity's coaches will help you. Being able to learn from experienced developers who review my code and point me in the right direction is priceless. They correct your code line by line, give advice and also encourage you when you need to improve some aspect of the code and when your code is correct. They check that the code meets specifications from a functional point of view and from a style point of view, very important aspects when working on teams in the real world. When we study at Udacity, we are part of a community, even after we graduate. You will work on several projects that will push you to learn things you never knew you could implement in a real world project. You'll learn how to learn, how to stay updated with new technologies and how be able to master them after you finish the Nanodegree. Career services are great, you can have your resume and profiles reviewed to improve your online presence. If you're thinking on signing up for the Nanodegree, do it! it will be a great investment for you future. 	2016-09-29T23:36:02.881Z	5832475609

Udacity, as a team and as individuals with whom I have had the pleasure to interact, is one of the best experiences in my life and I will continue to attend, even if I have to sell my own organs (well, maybe get a weekend partime job.  I'm a bit attached to my organs!)
Many, many thanks!!!"	2016-09-27T04:24:54.009Z	u6313684

1. You learn key concepts creating the lesson's project.
2. You demonstrate the ability to apply what you learn in the lesson by completing a working project.
3. You also build a portfolio with the projects completed in the course.

FEND was still a great learning experience, and since then a lot of great improvements have occurred, and that trend appears to be continuing.  Most of all I love the projects and the reviewer feedback... AWESOME!  It would be great if I all the bookmarked course links were available in one place to search, or if I had access to a way of searching them.  I tried  searching the classroom portal, but access is not available.  I am also glad that some coaches are open to any questions, and access has greatly improved with all coaches.  I plan on using that soon.	2016-07-01T05:48:58.839Z	5147461947

For example, I am currently working on a project with TypeScript, RequireJS, AngularJS (but Knockout is very interesting), Grunt for the tasks-automation (I prefer Gulp) and we use Karma and Protractor for our tests.

I think I really improved my skills, thanks to your support, and I am thinking about which nanodegree I should do now.

Thanks a lot !

I was taking state university courses while also taking the Nanodegree program.  If you're simply looking at Udacity from a value standpoint, compared to even a state university, Udacity is a far better value.  The quality of education is as good as or possibly better than that of a traditional school.  Udacity is steadily improving and expanding the areas of study that they offer and, I believe, will be extremely popular in the near future.  Thx Udacity!	2016-02-20T19:30:37.128Z	4377000837

If you do not have any IT background it will be very tough. However, there are so many supporting tools and community around you that when you feel completely lost and in the dark, there is always someone who could put some light on.
I have got five projects to complete. These projects required to build different skills, being each very relevant, up-to-date and meet the highest standards. Be prepared, you will code at night, during weekends and even in your dreams. Stackflow and google search will be your best friends.
But that is the point, you will learn how to search and process information, keep yourself up-to-date in order to make the right decisions, choose the most optimal tools to be an efficient, highly qualified professional .
At last, the financial incentive to complete the program within 12 months is awesome. I made it and got back my half tuition fee!

Even with 7 years of experience building fullstack web applications, I still find their content to be full of great tips for learning best practices, streamlining my workflow, etc.  I would highly recommend any of their Nanodegrees to anyone interested.

It allowed me a flexible way to use trial and error, explore additional technical topics(outside of the curriculum), and solve interesting real-world projects.  By providing a step-by-step course road-map I was also able to incrementally improve my abilities as a Front-End Web Developer and not be overwhelmed by the enormous amounts of information and rabbit holes I could have went down. 

My favorite part of the program was the project feedback given after each submission. I was very pleasantly surprised to see the amount of effort the reviewers put in their evaluation of each project. While they first make sure the project requirements are met and up to industry level coding standards, they also gave additional recommendations for best practice and links to articles on advanced topics for further exploration . 

It was apparent the course was developed from real world experience and by real-world developers because after getting my first job as a application support developer, I've already reflected back on lessons I completed earlier and found myself nodding my head in agreement with the instructor.

Finally, I really appreciated how current and up to date the courses were. As programming languages improve and best practices change, it's hard to know what new article or tip to follow. I definitely felt the courses stayed on top of this ever-changing environment.

I would definitely recommend to anyone interesting in becoming a front-end web developer (or those just looking for a fun and interesting challenge). This was the right choice for me!"	2016-01-17T16:33:16.670Z	872228873

Since I took it several very nice courses and activities have been added like Responsive Images, Browser Rendering Ops and Backbone.js Nutrition app so the breadth of techniques covered has improved.
On the negs, how engaged each cohort community will be seems hit-miss, coach help may not available at the moment you really need it.
Suggestion for future additions: project planning/kickstarting. Projects all have a starter repo of assets that are super helpful. But what happens when those training wheels are gone? For me, it was frustration stemming from uncertainty how to approach beginning a new project (I.e. lots of futzing around).
Overall would recommend with the caveat: you'll get out what you put in. Don't roll on until you understand the code you are committing, don't be in a rush when its ultimately your integrity on the line."	2016-01-16T23:02:04.259Z	599469737

As a father of 2, with a wife and a full time job (both demanding) there was no way I could learn enough quickly by reading a few pages from a technical book each night.  Udacity classes ramp up slowly but before you know it, like a lobster in a pot, you are swimming in the middle of something really hot and you didn't even realize how quickly it happened.  I went from having no confidence at all and engulfed with a fear of failure to a competent developer who could pickup a new CSS or JavaScript library and apply it to a project quickly, thanks to that fancy task runner, dependency checker and framework builder that is hanging from my developer tool-belt.  I'm up to full speed again and have surpassed many of the developers in my office.  The Udacity method of learning is fantastic and I am a Udacian for life!	2016-01-16T03:30:23.344Z	u6313684

I think this Udacity provides the most making sense program that I can easily understand and move forward with a new knowledge. I really like this program.

I'm trying to earn the Front End Developer degree however I feel like there are a lot more to learn than what I see on the curriculum sheet. When I discover more lessons ahead of me, I feel discouraged a bit. And also, the lessons go all over the places sometimes such as responsive image to Git. I wish there was the details curriculum already written (or am I missing something?). 

Also, when it describes you need to submit your project, I would like to see the link where I can submit on each project page. I don't want to spend my time to look for the link everywhere on the website. 

I hope I don't sound like a complainer but it's a little unintuitive on the UX. That's all. Over all, it's a great educational program. :) 

Thanks.

I've been employed as a tech generalist for over a decade and consider myself to have been an intermediate JS programmer before completing the program, and it took me a bit less than a month to complete. I don't exactly feel employable as a JS developer just yet, but I certainly feel more confident in my skills and ready to dive into the modern frameworks and tools in earnest. All said, it's extremely in-depth and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who's ready to take the step beyond beginner front-end developer. 	2016-11-22T03:58:55.879Z	4578418718

The focus of the program is not only about learning today's trends, but how to research your own documentation and resources so you can keep up to date on your own.

I especially like the projects and the reviews on the projects, they're tremendously helpful to improve my front-end skills..

I had zero knowledge about FrontEnd in the beginning of the course but now I am very confidant in the field. Some projects need a bit more attention I would say like the Testing Framework project but apart from that, it is a very good course to enter the world of FrontEnd programming. It makes you completely capable to try other web technologies on your own after the course and take it to another level. It would be very good if Udacity comes up with an advanced FEND program to complete what is not taught in this one to make the course material wholesome. But nevertheless, this program is excellent	2016-07-26T04:42:42.357Z	2388038540

One of the major being the Hack Reactor section of OOJS it was difficult even with my background in OOP from Java and Python. There was also a little bit of a gap in explanation of the Jasmine test suite and what exactly you do to get results. The biggest being that it lacked showing whether you could or could not use loops within it() or describe() I had to detour a little and try to figure out if this were possible or if it might break Jasmine but overall I loved this course and intend to still recommend Udacity whole heartedly. 	2016-07-25T04:13:05.775Z	5827909896

The course is a lot more challenging than I expected and,to me (a first time developer with no firsthand experience), sometimes can be a little disjointed but I put that down to assumed knowledge of certain areas.

I recommend taking @ least the Intro to HTML  as a prep course prior to taking this course. It didn't match my expectations because I thought it would be more reading intensive, but this course is very intensive on videos. It appears the videos are catered towards an audience that has very little college education as if it were teaching children HTML, CSS, JS, etc. I don't like how Udacity tries to simplify it so much it's making it more confusing than it suppose to be. I do like how it has so much freedom to learn & the opportunity to access resources that otherwise I wouldn't have known about. Thank you Udacity!

For one, as with anything that is CS related, a certain level of aptitude is assume of the student. There needs to be more 'instructor note' links to bridge those gaps of knowledge. 
Also, once you start taking the JS part of the course, the class starts pulling up quizes based on info from Intro to CS. As that is NOT a requirement for this course, it is a bit frustrating for someone who has not taken that class. Moreover, that class is a '3 month' class and not a simple 1-2 day deviation from the current lesson.

I'll give more updates on this assessment as I move along further.

I have also learned some skills that will be useful in a web development job that may have been hard to learn anywhere else from the level I'm at. My favorite course was JavaScript Design Patterns which teaches you how to organize your code. That course was so good that it should be a model for all other online courses. The reason I'm giving the program 4 stars instead of 5 is because there are a few courses in the program that need improvement.

It's not for the faint of heart and it challenges your ability to motivate yourself and learn independently.  However, that's exactly why you should take it.  In this nanodegree, you create many web products, and get your hands dirty with many web technologies.  You can do always do the basic requirements readily, but Udacity always provides stretch targets that truly test your understanding of the material.  I encourage everyone to do this.  The price you pay is a steal compared to a coding bootcamp, and a vast majority of the material would not be offered at a degree program in a university.  I can't wait for Udacity to provide job guarantees outside of the US, and I do believe Udacity is going to play a significant part in reforming the education system for generations to come.  Take this nanodegree or other nanodegrees in order to be part of an exciting, new educational model that will truly teach you skills in order to build products that will hopefully benefit the world.	2016-03-22T22:16:13.765Z	5243201430

Some courses are excellent, but few others, such as Intro to HTML and CSS, Javascript Basics, HTML5 Canvas (Probably the least helpful course of them all), and Intro to jQuery  need a bit more polishing.

The ones on Responsive Web Design fundamentals, Responsive Images,  Git & Github, Browser Rendering Optimization, Web Performance, JS Design Patterns and Object Oriented JS were great, although every course seems to be somewhat disconnected from the project, especially the one on Object Oriented JavaScript. I had to Google around for tutorials on HTML, CSS, jQuery, JS, and lots of other stuff on top of what I was learning in Udacity.

Oh yeah, the learning curve gets really (I mean, REALLY) steep in project 3 all of a sudden. There's a huge chasm there that needs to be addressed. In my opinion, it would be helpful if there were more examples similar to the projects that the students build, so that they can de-construct and learn from them. Learning everything from documentation is fine, but only after a certain level of proficiency is attained -- which is what the students come here to gain.

Nice program overall, but make sure you already know HTML, CSS and Javascript before enrolling. Otherwise, you'll probably spend more time looking up tutorials on Youtube.

- The course is very ""Googlish"", i.e. closely related to Google products and employees. Some courses were made by Google/Google employees, and some courses too much rely on Google products, especially Chrome. Website optimization project was only possible by using Chrome, and the app in P6 only worked in Chrome.
- The learning curve is too steep. In the beginning the nanodegree is ridiculously simple, and then it quickly gets very hard. You should raise the level at the start of the nanodegree."	2016-03-15T16:05:55.132Z	5446558826

This reduces the feeling of being stuck when you run into problems.  The program is dynamic so the way you get support will likely change over time.  Sometimes the material lags behind the underlying technology (Google Chrome Developer Tools ) but there is usually enough support in the forums to figure out workarounds.  I have a programming background but the course seems suitable for people of all backgrounds.  If you don't have a programming background you will need to actively utilize the different support avenues.  Overall I highly recommend this.

the only downside (which is why i didnt give it 5 stars) is that the knowledge you'll need to advance into your projects is more than the information provided in the supporting classes. so you'll definitely need to go hunt down more knowledge. but honestly the basics are so well explained here than expanding on it is a breeze!"	2016-03-04T15:04:46.382Z	6697038027

The equivalent coursework is available for free, and there are many equally supportive communities out there that don't require a fee to join.  Having my work thoroughly reviewed is worth the price in my opinion though ($100/month after 50% refund for finishing within 1 year).

Honestly, spending the money has also motivated me to work more diligently.  I don't care so much about the actual ""nanodegree"" certificate I'll obtain upon completion, but I'm sure it won't hurt in the job search.  Speaking of which, I was pleasantly surprised by how extensive the job search assistance is in this program.  Personal assistance with my resume was very helpful, and I expect the upcoming reviews of my Github and LinkedIn accounts will be similarly helpful.

On the negative side: Udacity's website could use some work, which is pretty frustrating when enrolled in their web development program.  I usually have to refresh my browser when logging in to get it to go through, and their mobile site is often infuriating to navigate (I'm not interested in the mobile app).  The program I'm enrolled in (Front-End Web Dev) also feels somewhat unfinished.  I've found placeholder messages in pinned forum threads, and while half-way through the program they added more content and a slack channel so the community could communicate more freely (good move).

Overall: 4/5, would recommend at what I paid ($100/month after refund)."	2016-02-14T15:49:53.473Z	5608871776

I think this particular Nanodegree is a perfect place to start for anyone who is interested in web development as a career but doesn't want to, or can't, take the time to learn full-time.  Take advantage of the forums, the webcasts, and, most importantly, the instructors.  That's where the real value of the course comes into play.  As for ways this course could be better, I think CSS should be emphasized more than it was.  Overall, I am very happy with the course.  It helped me make the transition from active-duty military to junior web-developer in a short amount of time :)	2016-02-04T04:46:54.675Z	3572749052

The project and course material have been good, and although there has been issues with some parts of the content, they have gone back and improved the material as feedback comes in. The main highlight of the program are the projects, which exercises and helps you to remember and build up what you've learned; it is hard enough in that you have to do some research to get it done, but not so hard that it is impossible to do, which is a good balance as it reflects real-world work environments. I'm now looking to continue to other nanodegree programs now as a result of going through this program, and am looking forward to the opportunities that would give me.	2016-01-20T00:45:04.458Z	1928308627

Granted, I am brand new to coding, and do not do it professionally, therefore I lack some of the reinforcement learning attendant to sheer hours of practice and repetition outside of the curriculum.  Effectively, this has led to the need for near-constant refreshing of material already covered in later projects.  Consequently, I am nearing the end of this degree, and I feel grossly unprepared for employment in the field.  Again, not sure how much of this is me vs. the program, but as the degree is targeted towards those with none to limited experience of coding and expected to spend at least 10 hours a week on the material, which I've certainly met, I would have hoped for a better experience.	2016-12-09T21:23:15.604Z	7122180081

However, I'm only giving it 3 stars because it has some course arrangement issues and because it's really a beginner course. As far as course arrangement goes, the beginning courses and projects are pretty boring. You learn how to build things with HTML and CSS, which is cool, but then you have to learn how to include random code snippets for optimizing image sizes and viewport widths. You don't get to the cool stuff (Javascript and page optimization) until much later. This needs to be fixed -- image and viewport optimization should go with the other optimization courses later in the course, and the student should be introduced to the fun of Javascript and jQuery as soon as possible. I actually delayed doing the early projects because they seemed like such a chore. Now that I know about page optimization in general, the early optimization projects seem more interesting. So that's all about course design. As far as the ""beginner-ness"" of the course is concerned, I mean that you won't be ready for front-end dev job work after this course. You'll be a novice! You haven't had enough experience yet with a project that requires you to use everything you've learned, as well as outside documentation on things you haven't learned. That said, I got exposed to elements of Front-end Dev that I would never have though to explore otherwise.

Or maybe it's just me ...?
In order to do your portfolio P1, it seems to me, that information about HTML, CSS, boxes, responsive websites, git, web tools, and more, is very important.
All of these courses are placed in different areas. Some are put on 'The path', some you have to go to a specific class, and then click 'overview' to find.
The tips for what is essential in order to perform well on your first project is difficult to find.
Anyways, the consequence for me is, that I try to do things before I have actually learned them, so I waste a lot of time first looking for the courses I need, organizing them in a sensible way. 
Also I waste a lot of time being frustrated, feeling rather stupid, because I am trying to handle something I know absolutely nothing about.
Handling frameworks is a very good example of that. The course on frameworks is well hidden.
FEND friends also advised me to seek about the course about web-tooling - in order to check out Grunt and Gulp. Haven't gotten around to that yet.

Progression of projects is a big fragmented and rarely goes into depth. Reviewing still leaves quite a bit to be desired. Basically it's students who just graduated grading on a fixed rubric, which means you are judged on functionality rather than quality. Maybe I was hoping for too much there...

The above being said, it does provide a decent introduction into Front-End Web development. Having project assignments helps put theory into practice. A bit of restructuring and more building on top of previous knowledge and projects and it could become good."	2016-01-29T21:44:00.668Z	102029761

Warning: below is my opinion, this course is exactly as it is described on the udacity site and is in no way misleading in any advertising or promises.

The one thing that keeps me in this program is probably the support from the forums.  I can post just about anything that I get stuck on and get help form the forum support staff, even if its not right away, its a good system.

The videos and tutorials are sometimes great and sometimes terrible.  The git series seems to be pretty good, but when they teach programming basics they tend to just kind of throw things at you with super random examples and then ask you to do things to update your code without really much warning or guiding to help the student understand what and why they are learning something.  
  It seems that their methodology is: well lets see if they can find out how to do this from googling it, which isn't as bad as it might seem due to the fact that most of the time when you run into a problem on your own thats whats going to be going on.
  I would love to see the program pivot away from this slightly though.  What I think they are missing in this step is the fact that there are a couple stages of learning something on your way to becoming an expert.  There is a stage where you dont know what you dont know, a stage where you know what you dont know, and a few further stages that dont necessarily apply to this level of training.  I think their interpretation of their students is that they are in a ""knowing"" of what they dont know, and in most situations that is correct or at least appropriatly assumed because of the course prereq's.  
That being said I think the missing piece of this is that, even if the student is in the supposed learning state, the student still has to try to both interpret what the course is trying to get them to do, why the course wants them to do said thing, how the course explicitly wants them to implement it, how it is normally implemented and how the skill/technique/syntax can be modified to fit what the course is expecting.  When you do all of these things at once it can be so overbearing that the learning is really lost and the goal is pressed towards just getting past each exercise instead of why each exercise helps them learn something and why that is important. 

This is being as critical as I can though and I believe that if you complete the program you will have the tools you need to move onto a front end job, if not because of the course material, then because of how difficult and frustrating figuring out what they want you to do can be (and the skill set you will build because of it)."	2016-01-12T01:37:10.254Z	u52393788

They try to make the learning entertaining, but get the balance really wrong. 
I'd strongly suggest looking at Daniel Shiffman's YouTube channel for examples of how to teach development (i.e. using a white board, with live laptop feed, and a small amount of fun thrown in).
Arguably the biggest problem is coherency and 'flow'. Lessons never really follow on.
For what is charged, you've got to do a lot better. I've heard some amazing stories about newer courses (e.g. AI) and perhaps Udacity has improved since making this one.

My advice would be: go back to the drawing board and write this whole degree again. New videos, with smaller, more frequent projects."	2016-12-16T15:55:30.982Z	5394696674

I understand the need to search the internet for solutions and to learn more about coding. I do that everyday but there seems to be a lack of supplemental support. Forums can help but from what I have seen the moderators have at times said the certain code examples look good but then students come back saying that it did not pass when submitted. Also, there was a video trying to explain or clarify the optimization project. The guy was in some cafe outdoors with a ton of background noise which basically ruined the video. This was very unprofessional. Another example is the 1 on 1 with mentor. I have had a major problem with support here. I  met with Ty and he has ignored all correspondence when he promised to get back with me on some code. In addition, I have followed up with support numerous times with no success.

So, I have paid almost $2200 in tuition for this education. In my book it's not worth it. I would advise others  to stay away from this program."	2016-07-05T20:35:04.920Z	4147608643

So basically, you have to investigate and learned by your own like around 75% of the material ""taught"", or maybe more, if you are new into programming.

Every single new video I view in my nanodegree displays a prominent advertisement for .... you guessed it: The nanodegree program!  It insists that I receive 1:1 coaching...I've been with this nanodegree for about 7 months, and only ever received information related to coaching when I first signed up.  The social groups app was taken down, and when I have made a request to switch groups to be with my friend, the support response was ""Why do you want to switch groups?""  ...My request included my reasoning.  Way to read.

The course instructors are distracting.  Why am I put into a position to watch this quasi-soap opera play out in front of me during a class?  I understand good comic relief, but I am horribly distracted by the terrible acting skills of the instructors.  Of the learning environments that I've utilized, sadly, I rate this among the least attractive.

After finally getting around to submitting a project, I received a failing score, which is fine, as the project was lackluster in my opinion.  That said, I followed the instructions, and fulfilled the criteria I found therein.  Upon receiving my ""Does not meet specs"" review, I saw the project template, which I hadn't seen before.  Shouldn't instructions be directly linked to a template, should that contain our guidelines for passing submissions?

Each time I have to find new information on the site, I find it cumbersome.  I'm very well versed in hunting for particular site features and information, but whenever I dig around Udacity, I seem to have significantly above-average difficulty in finding my desired content.  More specifically, I'm referring to the nanodegree material.

In my experience thus far, I find this content overpriced, underdeveloped in terms of user-engagement and usability, and far too often, just plain frustrating.  I've not had this experience with Coursera, KhanAcademy, CodeAcademy, Udemy, Lynda, Treehouse...even my Microsoft web app dev certification exam prep material was better organized.  Sigh.

I'm only still here because for some reason, I retain hope that upon the completion of my nanodegree, I'll be in a reasonably good position to enter into the web development workforce.  Likewise, I intend to get half my money back, so kudos for that motivational strategy.  Finally, I'm very interested in the development of online education systems, and while this review has been filled with negativity, I maintain optimism that someday (not today, unfortunately), Udacity will provide an exceptional user experience.

P.s. Thanks for existing.  Sorry for my frustration.  Please modify your site/lecture styles to stop frustrating people like me.

Don't expect to learn everything you need to complete a project from the course lectures.  You will do A LOT of googling and researching to figure out how to complete most of the projects.

Now I'm developing reflexive, data-driven web applications that are (in my opinion) pretty easy on the eyes. Beyond that, I've even extracurricularly begun to branch out, using different frameworks and experimenting with different modes of deployment. This course gives just the right amount of guidance, to the point where one has to figure a lot out on one's own, yet is still given enough to make great things in a short time. This course has only served to stimulate me in my progression towards competency, allowing me a very solid (though rudimentary, of course) understanding of how to go about implementing new tools and concepts. I am exceedingly pleased with the foundation I've been given to build upon, and I have nothing but excitement for the future. I've spent many happy hours buried deep in code, often banging my head against the wall, only to come out the other side with a sense of deep satisfaction having figured something out and creating things both functional and beautiful. It's been a journey I am proud to have undertaken, and I am awed by my progress (not tooting my own horn, but seriously, I'm quite excited by it). Thank you, Udacity.

I would say if you're starting programming, probably go to CodeAcademy to get used to typing code, and understand code. After that, my personal opinion, is only pay if you want to get a Fullstack type of job. Probably put extra time into the projects to go a little above and beyond also, what employers will be judging you on. If you simply want to learn, watch the videos for free, then get ideas of what to code online if you don't know what to make. 

As for price, a little unreasonable if you finish in the average time. Moreso if you aren't from Britain, the US because of currency rates. This is mainly because my learning style, I would rather Google it, figure it out myself instead of ask Udacity for guidance. You got the support if you need it though.

The program has pushed me to my limits testing out each and every key area which requires for you to be called as a ""Full Stack Developer"". In fact this program has taught me the real meaning of a Full stack developer. Initially I found it challenging when you have to write HTML and CSS but as the program progresses you need dive into all the backend features and their functionality. This gives you a hold on all the pieces (tech stack) be it SQL, Database Schema, Product Development, Designing, writing well formatted code, configuration and what not.

Learning bit of Front end to do project was also very helpful, though I had to do courses of Front-end Web developer nanodegree to understand things.
The best part was how responsive the reviews and Udacity support was in general. I got most of my project reviewed in 1-2 hours of my submission and they very patient with re-submission, which did a lot to meet the rubric.
I would highly recommend this Nanodegree and can sure the money investment will be worth it, as money investment and rubric forces you are learn so much more and take learning to next level.

The accredited university program:
Almost 10 times more expensive for each class (5 weeks long),
They have dated information,
Do not offer courses in cutting edge technology like python, swift, and go,
The grading is reduced to a simple 10/10 points for ""knowledge""...
Time limits and grading constraints reduce my ability to expand on interesting subjects

Udacity course work:
Ready to go profile of relevant work
Cutting edge course work
Updated and current content
Excellent grading and feedback on all course work
Relevant information (no time wasting fluff)
Lenient and broad requirements encourage broadened thinking and expanded deliverables

I am much more satisfied with my udacity course work and I look forward to the time when my experience here continues into the job market."	2016-01-28T00:43:37.130Z	5142239530

The projects lead you step by step into learning skills, building an application, and finally actually deploying the code into production from scratch. It offers a rare opportunity to learn best practices every step of the way with someone there to catch you if you ever get lost.

The Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree pushes you to do things real developers have to do on a daily basis.  I am much better at reading and understanding documentation.  I have to be able to find bugs and fix them.  I am still working on my Nanodegree, but I am confident when I am done I will have marketable skill that will help me land my first developer position.	2016-02-06T15:45:12.814Z	4466518557

There is no better options for the quality of the content vs the cost. I've been using Udacity for about 2.5 years now. Before I knew absolutely nothing and I started with some intro courses like Introduction to Computer Science. I was so fascinated that you could teach someone like me the underpinning of creating a search engine that I continued taking other intro courses until the Nanodegree program was initiated. Even though it's steep learning curve, it really pushes you. It's not easy but it's rewarding. After feel like a coding ninja who can solve any problem now.	2016-01-18T16:28:53.635Z	647249835

The first project felt rather throwaway. The second was pure DB-administration stuff, and around the time I thought ""backend may not be for me..."". The third is a full fledged webapp built on a Python framework; very fun. The fourth builds an API relying heavily on Google service apis; I don't know how portable those skills are. The fifth was remote server setup; my favorite course and project of this track. 
Overall, having taken FEND as well, I don't really see much of Front-end skills reflected which I assumed ""Full stack"" is meant to encompass.
Would recommend but with copious reservations/grilling of the prospective student and their likes/goals."	2016-01-16T23:09:40.578Z	599469737

You are taught to read the documentation and use tools such as github, pep8 linters, and vagrant VMs.  You do need to continue your education to adopt best practices, but this nanodegree is a few important steps towards those goals.  Add the fact that you can do this from your own home, at your own pace, and at an affordable price and it becomes one of the best options for many students.	2016-01-16T09:10:51.195Z	u37373

This was my first nanodegree, and although I think the experience is good, the content of this one is very outdated.

It would be better if it focused more on concepts than on technologies. Or even better, to focus on the concepts while using modern technologies.

Technology concepts are directly applicable to the work I do and I'm learning new tools to make my job easier.  However, the level of instruction is choppy.

However, the reason for giving 3 stars is that the instructions for project 4 and 5 are not as clear as project 1, 2, or 3.

The courses are way to short for the level of depth that I was expecting by starting this course. Also in fullstack foundations, you guys start off the lessons with a comically simple explanation for CRUD, but then immediately jump into SQL alchemy which more complicated to another order of magnitude.

By the time I reach project 3 and Project 4, I realized the code had so many bugs, Somethings went missing from the code and not shown in the videos which created a lot of confusion and a lot waste of time for a novice in the fullstack area. I believe code versioning is not handled properly with so much of emphasis on the use of git. I understand the program is going through an upgrade phase  but I am still continuing to pay $200 a month whatever issues your end. Not many 1:1 appointments are available when the 1:1 coaching is the highlight of the program which misguides the students here. I think if I am paying $200 a month I should be getting assistance whenever In need between the normal hours. If I had to depend on the discussion forum, I do not think I needed to pay $200. There is lots of freely available material over the internet. Instructors debug the code but I have no idea what went wrong and why since the 30 minutes slot are good enough to bug the code alone not explain to the student neither is the instructor tries to educate the student on the misses. Just that I had taken the Python course perviously and enjoyed it, I thought it would be good experience taking the fullstack course but itseems a expensive state of affair. Overall not a great one.	2016-03-10T03:34:34.505Z	4179378992

Most of the time, the acual code and solution code are different from the instructor code so if you follow along in the video, you are almost guaranteed that your project won't work. The files that the course say are all included in the forked project files are NOT all included or even correct so you spend wasted time hunting down the issues and trying to find the solutions to just get the sample problems to work.
1 on 1 coaching is very difficult to find a time when you can even use it in your schedule let alone just find an open available slot.
The course content is constantly changing throughout the coursework so if you run into problems and find it taking a while, the course will have changed anyway and new material and assignments will be added that you need to complete making it take even longer.
The overall concept of what this nanodegree is trying to provide is good and would be useful to some, but it fails so poorly in it's delivery that it isn't worth the time or effort."	2016-01-27T05:15:02.907Z	3333779012

More importantly, the Google platform is so complicated and I don't know any developers who use it. Just seems like a big advertisement​ for Google.

I had no experience of android and perhaps no interest. So i wasn't sure about joining nanodegree. One thing I did was to complete a basic course on android from udacity which helped me a lot to understand basics very well. Then once I was confident enough I enrolled in this nanodegree. The degree is super awesome and covers a lot of content for android. After completing this one will certainly master android. Projects play important role. There are many videos for any topic so why would someone spend money for any stuff. But this is not true, here you learn things and then struggle hard to use those things in your own project. There are times when you end up not finding the cause of problem or how to solve it, then there are super cool mentor's who will guide you. There are discussion forum for each project and all other stuff. On top of all this you get one to one session where you can discuss some issue. So for me it's platinum package. So don't miss it!	2017-01-20T12:55:59.422Z	5513338723

My association with Udacity did exactly the same. Beyond the confines of textbooks and classroom based learning, I had a chance to put my ideas into practice and develop ‘Kaastkaar’- an android app to link the farmers with consumers. What really worked for me was the Udacity Forum, where I would get answers to all my queries and doubts on the click of single button. Looking back, I feel that resigning from my job and taking a leap into the unknown was the best decision I could have taken for my career and personal growth.

It was an amazing feeling to receive my first ever online degree! In this post, I share my journey to become a certified android developer. Hope this post will be helpful for the people who wants to make the career in Android development.

The journey started way back in 2013. I wanted to create something of my own which others can use. Through my graduate and postgraduate studies, I knew Java programming, so I thought of creating android apps which could be useful for the students. 

I started to learn myself. At first, I struggled a lot understanding android documentation. But I did not give up. Then after few days of practicing demos, reading online materials, I got confidence. So I started working on a real time idea. The idea was suggested by my husband, the idea was to develop an android application for students who are preparing for Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) exam. Creating something new from scratch was a difficult job. It was required to gather lots of data, designing of screens, building beautiful yet easy to use user interface, linking different screens and so on. Indeed it was all challenging job, but I accepted the challenge and published my first ever application in one and half year. The outcome was incredible, the users accepted my application wholeheartedly. They gave such an amazing feedback that I can't express in words! This overwhelming response motivated me to publish another 4 apps and learn Android.

Meanwhile developing my own apps (All Edu Apps), I found that Google and Tata Trusts were offering 1000 scholarships to Indian students for an Android Developer nanodegree created by Udacity. I was very excited about this opportunity. I applied for the scholarship and I got selected on 27 Jan 2015. I was very happy and excited to be among thousand students across the India. Receiving scholarship was a sort of responsibility to complete the degree on time and prove that their selection was not wrong.

I completed total 8 projects in this program. Each project has a supporting course and forum for asking corresponding queries. Additionally, we could take appointments with the coach , there were webcasts and lots of helpful material to complete the projects on time. The last project (capstone) was really interesting one. The project was about developing a brand new app and it should fit all the requirements specified by Udacity. I developed an Android app called 'Arogyasathi' meaning health partner. This application is for patients and doctor. Through this app, a patient can book an appointment, keep track of previous appointments and medicines etc. A doctor can view today's patient list and prescribe medicines. The app also shows basic information about the hospital, doctor, fees for various tests and so on. I used firebase as a backend for this app.

The whole journey was wonderful. I enjoyed doing all projects. When I was on my last project I received an invitation for a career summit organized by Google, Tata Trusts and Udacity at Google office in Bangalore. That was also really amazing experience as we interacted with Googlers, other android developers who have completed their nanodegree. The most important thing I liked about nanodegree was forum support and quality feedback on code/project submission. The forum mentors were encouraging and quick in responding to queries. The syllabus is exactly what today's industry demands which truly fits the tagline of @Udacity's ""Be in Demand"". It helped me to master my existing knowledge, gain new knowledge and prepared me for exciting future opportunities. I feel confident about whatever I learned during the course of this nanodegree program.

I would like to wholeheartedly thank Udacity for providing such a wonderful platform to learn and hone my skills. I would also like to thank Google and Tata Trust for offering me the scholarship. Last but not least I would also like to thank all my fellow nanodegree students for providing me help whenever required.

Definitely, ​it deserves 5 starts!"	2016-12-23T04:40:37.408Z	635858831

Coming from a C# and Xamarin background I have learned many Android best practices that I will start applying to my apps.  I also enjoyed programming in Java once again and I am seriously thinking of switching back to Android Studio from Xamarin.  I guess when I was working with Android Studio a few years back it was very buggy but the current release is very stable.  Anyways, the best thing I got out of this program is learning Android best practices and libraries I could use to simplify my life.	2016-11-22T16:44:53.346Z	9386730246

The forums are actually extremely helpful and the coaches are usually available to help out.

Different sections are taught differently so you get a slightly different style each time, but the content is still helpful. Honestly, you learn more from doing the projects themselves than just watching the videos, and the code review is great. 

Some downsides are the site is difficult to navigate. It should not take that many clicks to get to a specific video! Also, their 1:1 scheduling system is a little messed up. I've had a lot of communication issues using it and ended up having to contact coaches directly. 

All in all, if you complete this course, you'll learn how to be an Android Developer. Their career development courses helped a lot with my resume, too. Definitely worth the investment. "	2016-10-12T15:21:36.197Z	5010107132

Because it is self-paced, I find myself wanting to work harder, knowing that the quicker I learn this, the better off I'll be. Because of the way it is set up, I really do have to learn it, and can't simply copy and paste all of my answers and pass. No cheat codes here! The only negative thing for me is the lack of a chat or instant message for quick questions to an instructor. All of the times that seem to be open to set up a 30-minute one-on-one are either while I'm at work, or late at night (11pm at the earliest in my time zone). If there was a instant chat, this would be absolutely perfect, no flaws to be found.	2016-09-10T18:54:04.916Z	6593308188

The content is of the best quality.

Take the trial and/or go through the videos first to get to know about the content quality.  One thing I can assure you of is that you'll definitely learn.

3. Comparing the original Phone application - it was extremely hard for me to understand the flow of the entire coursework. It took me few months before I got used to the whole Nanodegree. Not sure how this could have been improved, but I was a little nervous.

I tried to learn Android dev on my own with books, Udemy courses, and online tutorials, but none of which was effective. This program really got me thinking more and digging more, which was important to my learning, knowledge retention, and as a general problem-solver. The curriculum and code reviews are first-class and the cost of which was much lower than the coding bootcamp I took, with similar, if not higher outcome. I thought the remote nature of the program would be a hindrance to my learning, but I found the discussion forum to be very useful with a high level of engagement and excellent response time by the mentors. 

Overall, I am really happy with the program regarding my learning outcome, cost, and effectiveness. I highly recommend this program."	2016-04-02T15:27:57.409Z	1008359887

Each time, I learn something new and I enjoy it greatly. The first couple of projects felt to be paced slowly and giving you more time to get familiar with the process and the tools. That made me be more lenient about the deadlines. By project 4, I got hooked! I am seeing real progress and I'm eager to see how far I can get. Getting feedback is really useful and I can't understate how important it is!
Which brings me to the communication with the tutors. Now that is what I call fast response system that actually works.
Including an intro to GitHub, right from the start is a great choice! More of the developer courses should have it, at the very least to refresh the knowledge.

Best of all, I like making cool things and learn how to make them. This nanodegree gives exactly this opportunity! I am motivated, excited and happy simply because I enjoy to see a cool app come to life from my efforts :)"	2016-02-27T19:10:08.208Z	3622248914

There are so many advances occurring right now in computer science, and it's essential to use such a teaching style, one that focuses on hands-on, industry-important skills above all. Other MOOCs traditionally model courses after a University-style education, which is very important in many cases. That being said, in order to become proficient in many of the technologies that are essential in this day and age, a more practical learning approach as used by Udacity is far more effective, ideally being supplemented with a University education, which certainly has its advantages as well. In my opinion, although a University education is worth its weight in gold, providing students with knowledge about the fundamentals, theory, etc. of computing and programming, nothing can beat Udacity's approach for students who are simply looking to pick up important, relevant skills like Android development.	2016-02-03T23:47:56.264Z	4365628641

I believe that the most important HCI investment for the next decade would be in analysis and representation of vast amounts of data. All algorithms for data analysis are designed to produce useful summaries of the data, from which decisions are made. Through my research I want to make it easier for people to organize, manage, and perceive user life experience data. I plan to continue my research in academia or in the industry.	2016-01-25T22:27:55.286Z	1011678756

b) All aspects of android platform is covered, databases, messaging, asycnhronous communication, cloud endpoints, material UX and android wear.
c) Instructions and follow up of the learning by submitting project is a fantastic feedback loop of learning and demonstrating your skills.
I do not believe there is any other such android program out there yet. Being a software engineer it has helped be being a confident android engineer."	2016-01-25T06:02:17.916Z	u742073

The courses and teachers were very helpful and valuable, extremely dense with material. The projects are the key to really understanding and applying the material. I feel that the quality of the code reviews have gone down over time - it feels like they are being machine graded now and/or given a very brief skimming by a human. While I'm sure this is great for Udacity's profit and scalability, it is of detriment to the student's user experience and education. 	2016-11-08T15:35:41.498Z	3499199458

You guys add ""links"" to updates in the instructor notes, but the videos and code examples remain stale. The student does not expect this from an online course. Online courses are expected to be updated as soon as possible. Also, since Udacity actually developed this course in collaboration with Google, the course content could be prepared in advance and updates could be uploaded the day Google announces something new. But no, you guys don't update the course videos for months !!

Also, I was expecting a more exposure to memory Analysis, Profiling, Architecture, etc. but you simply touched on these topics. This course seems to be very slightly above the Android Basics Nanodegree in terms of ""Advanced Topics"", which in itself was disappointing."	2016-11-02T15:09:30.462Z	7653384450

The strengths of this program are the various projects (especially the ""Capstone"" project where you work on your own idea) and the review system, all of which help to get comprehensive knowledge of the Android dev ecosystem. But there are some downsides, specifically:

1. The course videos aren't all that great, in my opinion. Now it's possible that my style of learning doesn't gel well with Udacity's style of video-making (lots of short videos, sparse on information). I like my videos packed with info, but I can see why others would like sparse videos too.

2. There is an entire project dedicated to making an Android Wear watchface, and although it can be argued that it's fun to work on, I don't believe it belongs in this program, which should be focused on Core Android skills. First of all, the Android Wear tooling (emulator setup, etc) is nowhere near as good as the regular tooling - you will run into all kinds of issues, many of which are poorly-documented online. It's an exercise in frustration, honestly. Second, I'm not convinced that smartwatches are the next big category of consumer tech devices - just look at the market performance of these devices. So making it a mandatory part of this program is a bit over-optimistic in my view."	2016-10-26T10:11:22.839Z	301117469

In short, take this, but be warned that you'll have to work a lot more on your own, a huge lot, to really get going.	2016-07-14T10:49:52.321Z	5243299494

Also, the extra projects in the nanodegree program forced me to actually work on projects, which forced me to learn (otherwise, I would have just watched the videos, which would have been beneficial, but doing is really to only way to learn). 

One thing I didn't like is that the courses do seem to force a certain way of developing Android apps. For example, there's a heavy emphasis on content providers, which is fine, but when I asked my people who actually did Android development for a living, most of them don't use content providers. Another example of this is the final project. I found myself building my app just to check off the requirements, rather than really building the best app I could. Due to this, this course felt like it was forcing me to learn Android development a certain way, rather than mirroring what people do in the real world. It reminded me a lot of the public school system, where they try to enforce a certain style of learning as a one-fits-all solution. I think the course would have been better if it taught general concepts but allowed the students to run wild-free with their projects.

Overall, I thought it was a great course. Thanks to Udacity (and Google) for putting all of the content together."	2016-02-05T01:42:55.802Z	6058288561

I find the structure of the content to be largely ineffective and there is a large gap between the theory discussed in a lecture and actually grasping the new concepts to the degree you can practically apply them. Far too often, the solution to moving forward is to simply copy code provided at a GitHub link and then move on. But this compounds as the lessons progress and eventually the project is comprised of more code you don't understand than code you do. This is obviously counterintuitive to the goal to actually learn this skill. My frustration with the quality of the lectures and the degree to which they are mapped to the exercises and skills needed for projects led me to try a different approach on this most recent project. I watched almost none of the course videos and skipped to the project rubric. I reviewed the expectations in the rubric, reviewed the starter code for the project, then started Googling around to find docs and StackOverflow posts about what I needed to figure out how to do. I found this experience to be _better_ than stumbling through the video content and exercises. When I got stuck, I used the forums, which are helpful. Alex and Nico are great. I attempted to schedule a mentor call which unfortunately turned out to be useless. The ""mentor"" spent most of the call Googling around for examples he could show me related to my question. My ask, though, was quite simple; walk me through how to construct a query for a content provider. He wasn't able to directly or effectively answer the question, so I left that session still lost and ended up posting in the forums. 

As someone working a full-time job while working through this course, I need my time spent to be as efficient as possible. I don't think the quality of the content for this program makes that possible right now. Beyond that, if I find more direction starting with a project rubric and make better progress Googling for content, I think the value I get from this program is very low relative to the cost I pay. 

The overall idea of the program is great; the online portal itself is easy to use, the forums are helpful, the projects seem to expose me to useful topics for the most part. But the course content that the program rests on top of has a really long way to go before I'd recommend anyone new to this stuff."	2017-01-21T00:58:30.239Z	u185551

I'd recommend some making some videos showing how the back end of the Sunshine app is being designed, and how that design breaks down into Android components.

It gives you all the knowledge and tools to build your confidence for going deeper into building more complex and better structured apps.

It has a lot of short focused videos on what is most used and important in iOS Development. The projects at the end of several lessons would encourage you to use the what you learned and incorporate it into the project's solution. Information is constantly being updated so that you know what are the best practices in the technology field. This online school is designed precisely to teach you what you need and I wished I attended this four years ago. I recommend engineers of all level to take a nanodegree and get a breadth of information that will make them a more well rounded engineer. The profession development courses and reviews is equally good.	2017-02-04T18:30:37.519Z	8255141202

Whilst I think it could have been made a tad easier by teaching more, I think it actually works towards your benefit, that for some projects there isn't too much hand holding, and you have to learn how to find the solutions to things you want, by searching for it.

Udacity provides half of the codes for the first two projects but you will figure out on your own for the rest of the other projects. Very exciting challenges!

Unlike other online education, the track for the Nanodegree allowed me to think about how some of the tools may be implemented onto an app. Once I took the initiative to implement the skills taught to me on to an app, it was one of the most rewarding experiences ever. I highly recommend this program.	2016-03-09T17:28:54.546Z	6749706180

The feedback reviews of your projects are incredibly useful. Furthermore, it is possible to learn good programming practices, design patterns, how to find answers on forums and on the documentation, etc. This was really important to me because I'm not currently working as a Software Engineer and all the content that is taught in the course made me a better programmer overall. Finally, this course teaches not only how to be better technically as a programmer but also how to do well in your interviews and how to prepare your resume. 10/10 for sure.	2016-03-01T16:22:07.985Z	u139903

Still, I knew I needed to better understand both the fine points (using Automatic-layout well) and some major concepts (Closures and multi-threading). The Nanodegree certainly gave me that. The projects were interesting, the examples were useful, and the explanations were very helpful. Some of the lessons could have been explained better as they were either too easy, or ignored some important details, but overall it was a good experience with friendly social support.	2016-03-10T20:23:13.085Z	4170588568

I first started with very minimal coding skills, and having completed this nanodegree I feel very confident in my iOS development skills. This program will teach you all the tools you need to grasp at least the fundamental concepts and allow you to learn further concepts on your own. There were some discrepancies on videos and lessons that led to some confusion, but the Udacity coaches and forum mentors are very good at answering any questions you may have. I particularly appreciated the code review and the super helpful comments I received from the reviewers.	2016-02-23T08:05:06.782Z	59863257

The lessons are great, covering various topics in detail. The exercises and mini-projects are good ways of testing yourself and ensuring that you understand the material. For the main projects that must be completed to earn the credential, only rough guidance is provided. This forces you to learn a decent amount of material on your own, which can get very frustrating at times. The forums and Coach Appointments can be helpful, but have their own pros and cons. Despite these minor issues, I would highly recommend the iOS Nanodegree.	2016-02-18T18:22:42.093Z	1110638653

The videos go pretty well, especially at 1.25x or 1.5x speed. There's a bit too much emphasis on showing you all four ways to do the same thing in Xcode. But the UIKit coverage is in logical order, and the projects are doable but occasionally challenging.	2016-01-22T11:19:25.098Z	3576528640

It is a lot more self-directed than I had expected, and pushes you to find answers on your own.  I appreciate having impartial feedback on the projects to make sure I am on the right track.	2016-01-18T00:29:15.001Z	865960220

Absolutely flawless lessons and clear explanations, perfect pace and progression. If you can have him make every lesson I would give this Nanodegree 5 stars. The github one is seriously mediocre, the MemeMe V1.0 is very disorganized and all over the place. I'm only 1/4 through the Nanodegree though, so this is my general impression so far.	2016-01-24T20:46:57.862Z	6483130756

We went from videos and examples where everything was explained, and then dropped down to where we were told to just copy and paste something because ""it's too complicated"" or being presented with a wall of text instead of a lesson.  This felt lazy and felt like whoever was writing the course content just gave up.  I had to consult many external tutorials in order to learn most of the Core Data lesson...and overall this really soured my experience with Udacity.  Enough that I'm a little concerned that an Android class would be more of the same song and dance."	2016-10-21T20:47:37.929Z	6569158593

I've never been able to take advantage of it.  When Swift 2.0 came out, I had to manually research and fix so many things that should have been fixed more quickly.  It took way too long to fix all the kinks.  These things have discouraged my progress and almost made me give up.  But I will not.  I will finish.	2016-02-25T07:21:27.384Z	u10634917
